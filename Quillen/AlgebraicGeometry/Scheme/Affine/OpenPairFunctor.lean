# The original fixed-open coefficient functor

The source open immersion is pulled back once at each coefficient algebra. The original
pullback lifts give a strict functor to opposite schemes. The specified inclusions form a
natural transformation from the original affine coefficient functor. At the identity algebra
we retain the existing projection isomorphism, rather than identifying its source with the
original open. No quasi-compactness assumption is used.
