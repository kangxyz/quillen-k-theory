# Descent from the original open-skeleton neighborhood pieces

Prescribed maps on the old neighborhood and its actual disk collars descend
through the proved open restricted attachment quotient when they agree on
their original attaching-sphere points. All fiberwise compatibility is proved
from the actual characteristic maps; it is not an additional input.
