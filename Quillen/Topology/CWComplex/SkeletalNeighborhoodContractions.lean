# Exactly compatible contractions of actual skeletal neighborhoods

Starting with one original open n-cell, `skeletalNeighborhood` repeatedly
applies the actual half-radius collar enlargement. Stage k is open in the
original strict skeleton of dimension n + 1 + k. Its inverse image in every
earlier stage is precisely that earlier neighborhood.

For a prescribed point in the original cell, `skeletalNeighborhoodContraction`
constructs ambient contractions to that same original point. Stage k waits
through the positive time `dyadicWait k`. In the next stage the collars move
only between the new and old waiting times, after which the old contraction
is evaluated at its unchanged time. Consequently all finite-stage contractions
agree literally at every time on their common original points.

No finiteness, local-finiteness, or countability assumption is used. All maps
to the whole complex and all inter-stage maps are actual subtype inclusions.
This module does not construct the global union or descend its homotopy.
