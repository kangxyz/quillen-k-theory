# Actual global lifting from a classical CW complex

A strict cubical boundary-lifting map lifts every continuous map from the
original Hausdorff classical-CW subtype. The function is assembled from the
constructed finite-stage lifts, whose compatibility proves independence of
which containing skeleton is used. Its continuity follows on each original
characteristic disk and then from the actual characteristic quotient.

This is global map lifting only. No cylinder lifting, prescribed-endpoint
homotopy, Whitehead conclusion, singular counit comparison, realization
domination or cover-existence theorem is assumed or asserted here.
