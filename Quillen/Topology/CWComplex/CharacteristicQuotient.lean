# The actual characteristic quotient of a classical CW complex

The domain is the coproduct of the literal characteristic closed disks.
Hausdorffness is explicit:
it turns compact characteristic images into closed subsets of the ambient space.
The target is the actual subspace C, not all of an unrelated ambient space.
