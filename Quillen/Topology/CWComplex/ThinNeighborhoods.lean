# Actual ambient-thin neighborhoods of arbitrary classical CW subtypes

The constructed global ambient contractions provide an open neighborhood of
every original point. Actual local path connectedness, already obtained from
the original characteristic quotient, permits passage to its open pathcomponent.
This gives exactly the geometric input for the existing path-class covering.
No local-finiteness, finite-dimensionality or countability assumption occurs.
