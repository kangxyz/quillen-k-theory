# Open neighborhoods across one actual CW skeleton

An open subset of the previous skeleton is enlarged by the radial collar over
its inverse image on each original attaching sphere. The resulting subset of
the next skeleton is open, and its inverse image in the old skeleton is exactly
the starting subset. These assertions follow from the actual attachment
quotient, with saturation proved using characteristic interior injectivity and
open-cell disjointness.

The quotient restricted to this open neighborhood is explicitly retained. In
particular, none of these open subsets is assumed to have a CW structure.
