# An actual open ambient-contractible neighborhood in a classical CW complex

The union of the constructed skeletal neighborhoods is a subset of the
original CW subtype. Its intersection with every stage skeleton is exactly
the corresponding finite-stage neighborhood. Openness is proved using the
original characteristic quotient, rather than treating skeletal open sets
as ambient open sets.

The exactly compatible finite-stage homotopies define a single ambient
contraction on this union. Its joint continuity is descended through the
actual characteristic quotient restricted to the proved-open union and
multiplied by the compact interval. A coproduct of restricted original disks
is proved to be a continuous open surjective presentation of that restricted
source. Each m-dimensional disk is controlled by the single finite stage m.

No countability, finite dimension, local finiteness, or compact-support
hypothesis is imposed, and the open neighborhood is not given a CW structure.
