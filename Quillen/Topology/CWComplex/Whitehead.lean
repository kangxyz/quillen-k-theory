# Whitehead for the exact original map between classical CW subtypes

The original mapping-path endpoint of a weak map has genuine finite boundary
lifting. Global CW lifting constructs a section over the target. The stored
mapping path gives the right inverse homotopy. Prescribed-endpoint CW homotopy
lifting joins the original constant-path inclusion to the section composed with
the map, and source projection gives the left inverse homotopy.

Both ambient spaces lie in the same universe because the canonical MappingPath
and finite-cube characterization have that restriction. No arbitrary-universe
transport, singular-realization counit, compact HELP, domination, covering
space, or conversion of CW notions is assumed.
