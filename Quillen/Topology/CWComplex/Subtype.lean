# The intrinsic classical CW structure on the actual complex subtype

The original characteristic maps are retained on their entire closed disks.
Their irrelevant values outside those disks are replaced by a supplied point
of the complex. This makes their codomains the actual subtype, and the inverse
maps remain the original inverse maps composed with subtype inclusion.

All CW fields are constructed directly. In particular, closure-finiteness
uses the same finite cell carriers and weak topology is transported through
the actual closed subtype inclusion. No homeomorphism-transport theorem or
conversion to the abstract categorical CW notion is assumed.
