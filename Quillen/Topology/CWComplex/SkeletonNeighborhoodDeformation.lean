# The actual one-step neighborhood deformation

The new collars move radially to their original attaching spheres, while the
old neighborhood is fixed. The retraction and the homotopy are constructed
from those formulas and descended through the actual restricted-open quotient.
Joint continuity explicitly uses this quotient multiplied by the compact
interval. No deformation or retraction certificate is supplied as a premise.
