# The whole-open-cell seed for a classical CW neighborhood

Each original open n-cell is an open subset of the actual (n + 1)-st strict
skeleton. Its chart is constructed from the original characteristic partial
equivalence and its continuous inverse. Convexity of the literal sup-norm
open disk supplies a contraction to any prescribed point, stationary through
time one half. Zero-dimensional cells are included.

Only one neighborhood at each point is needed by the ambient-thin construction.
Consequently the whole open cell is sufficient; no small-radius refinement or
local-finiteness hypothesis is introduced.
