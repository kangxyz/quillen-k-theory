# The first possible relative homotopy group and the actual unreduced cone gap

For a map from a simply connected space, the proved finite homotopy-excision theorem gives
an extra degree of connectivity for its original cone gap. The actual common-base fiber map
therefore preserves the first possible nonzero relative homotopy group, including relative
degree two. Its inner path is the full original cone cylinder and its outer path is unchanged.

The supplied cylinder path also identifies the iterated fiber with the cone loop space.
The resulting vanishing criterion is purely homotopical: no homology comparison or Hurewicz
theorem is assumed or asserted.
