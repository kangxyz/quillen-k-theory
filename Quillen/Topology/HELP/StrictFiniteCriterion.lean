# Weak equivalences characterized by strict finite cube HELP

Only literal finite cube-boundary pairs are tested. An actual strict square
has a lift up to homotopy fixed on its whole original boundary. The proved
HEP correction for that same pair recovers every prescribed boundary path,
so the existing finite full-HELP criterion applies. Dimension zero remains
part of the condition; no nonempty-source or compact-pair assumption is added.
