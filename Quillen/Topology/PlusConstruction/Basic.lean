# Homological certification of an original plus-construction map

`IsPlusConstruction` records the local-coefficient characterization in the
explicit coefficient universe: the actual based fundamental-group map is
surjective with the specified perfect kernel, and the original continuous map
preserves homology for every target local system. The source and target are
path-connected. The chosen basepoint path is retained in the induced map.

For connected CW spaces, when the coefficient universe is large enough, this
is the usual homological characterization of a plus construction (Weibel,
*The K-book*, IV.1.4.1 and IV.1.6). This module uses that characterization as
its definition. It does not prove a general CW
existence theorem, uniqueness, or equivalence with homotopy-fiber acyclicity.
In particular, construction of a value of this predicate must discharge every
local-coefficient comparison; naming the predicate supplies no such proof.
