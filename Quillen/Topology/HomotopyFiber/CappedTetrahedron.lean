# The exact shared-cap source tetrahedron cocycle

The six increasing edges of one actual source tetrahedron supply one cap each.
Its four face caps are restrictions of these same six paths, through proved
equalities of actual singular edges. Centrality of the original connecting
image and associativity give the four-defect relation. When the actual source
Pi two vanishes, the original LES makes the connecting map injective, giving
the exact alternating tetrahedral cocycle in the original target Pi two.

This statement concerns a source tetrahedron; ambient target tetrahedra still
require their own source representation and cap/basepoint comparison.
