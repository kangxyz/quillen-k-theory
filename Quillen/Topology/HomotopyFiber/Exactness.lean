# Exactness at the source of a map

For the concrete path-space homotopy fiber of a based continuous map `f : X → Y`,
the image of the homotopy-fiber projection on each positive-dimensional homotopy
group is precisely the kernel of the map induced by `f`.

The reverse inclusion is proved geometrically: a representative cube whose
image under `f` is nullhomotopic relative to its boundary lifts to the homotopy
fiber by taking the nullhomotopy paths as its second coordinates. No fibration,
long-exact-sequence, or localization theorem is assumed.
