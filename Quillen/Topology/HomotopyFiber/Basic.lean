# The actual topological homotopy fiber

The homotopy fiber of `f : X → Y` over `y` consists of pairs `(x, γ)` with
`γ(0)=f(x)` and `γ(1)=y`, using the compact-open topology on paths.
This is infrastructure for localization; no fiber-sequence or long-exact-sequence
theorem is asserted merely by defining this space.
