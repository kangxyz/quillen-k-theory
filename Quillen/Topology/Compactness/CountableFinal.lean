# Compact subsets of countable final covers

A compact subset of a T1 space with the final topology for countably many maps
is contained in the images of finitely many of those maps. The proof selects
points escaping successively larger finite unions. Every subset of their range
is closed, since its inverse image in each source is a finite union of closed
fibers. Compactness excludes the resulting infinite closed discrete subset.
