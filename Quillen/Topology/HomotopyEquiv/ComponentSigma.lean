# Discrete labels and the actual disjoint union of path components

A continuous discrete label whose fibers are the specified path components
gives a homeomorphism from their topological disjoint union to the original
space. The forward map is exactly the component inclusions. Openness can also
be transported through actual domination maps and their displayed homotopy.
No discreteness of path components of an arbitrary space is assumed.
