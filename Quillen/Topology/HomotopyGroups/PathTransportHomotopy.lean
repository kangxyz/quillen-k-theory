# Homotopy invariance and reversal of the original basepoint transport

The original free-path-evaluation transport depends only on the endpoint-fixed
homotopy class of its path. Reversing the path gives its inverse. Both statements
hold in every finite degree, including degree zero, and follow from actual
continuous squares.
