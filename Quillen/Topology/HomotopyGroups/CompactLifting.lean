/-! # Actual homotopy-group bijections from injective compact-source lifting

An injective continuous map that admits exact lifts of compact-source maps
induces bijections of the genuine homotopy sets. Injectivity forces every
lifted cube boundary and both endpoints of every lifted relative homotopy
to retain the original chosen values. No fiber or weak-equivalence conclusion
is included in the lifting hypothesis.
