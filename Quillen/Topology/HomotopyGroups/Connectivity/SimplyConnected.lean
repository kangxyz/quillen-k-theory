# The initial connectivity range for simply connected spaces

Simple connectedness kills the actual finite homotopy sets in degrees zero and one.
Consequently the original map to a point is two-connected, while an arbitrary map between
simply connected spaces is one-connected. These statements use the actual homotopy fibers;
they contain no homological recognition assumption.
