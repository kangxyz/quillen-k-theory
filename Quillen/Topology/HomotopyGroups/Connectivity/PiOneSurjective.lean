# One-connectivity from the original fundamental-group surjection

For connected source and target spaces, Pi zero is bijective. Surjectivity of
the original Pi one map therefore makes the actual fiber at that point path
connected by the proved pointed-set long exact sequence. Actual target paths
transport the conclusion to every fiber and every fiber basepoint.
