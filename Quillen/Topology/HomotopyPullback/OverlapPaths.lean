# Original paths for the homotopy pullback of two subspace inclusions

The existing strict-square comparison sends an actual overlap point to its constant path.
The stored path determines both actual endpoint coordinates, so its equality detects equality
in this homotopy pullback. Continuous path families with their original endpoint membership
proofs give the corresponding actual homotopy-pullback maps.
