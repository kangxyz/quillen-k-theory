# Canonical weak cartesian comparisons under change of total source

A weak map of total sources over a common base induces the original weak
map of homotopy pullbacks, retaining the full parameter and path. The exact
comparison triangle transports weak cartesianness back to the original
square. Neither an inverse map nor a fibration of total sources is needed.
