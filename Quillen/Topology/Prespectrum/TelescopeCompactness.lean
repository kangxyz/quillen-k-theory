# Compact images in the original reduced telescope

With T1 stage spaces, every compact subset of the original reduced telescope
lies in finitely many original stage cylinders. In particular this holds for
maps from compact spaces and for their whole compact-parameter homotopies.
The collapsed base ray causes no difficulty: the argument uses the final
quotient topology and closed point fibers, not a height function.

These statements give finite-cylinder support. Deformation to an original
stage and the homotopy-group colimit comparison are separate assertions.
