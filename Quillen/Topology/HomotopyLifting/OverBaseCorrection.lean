/-! # Original comparison homotopies corrected vertically over the base

The first actual lift restores the displayed base map while fixing the zero
set. Parallel-lift straightening then supplies a coherent vertical comparison,
retaining that entire set. No ordinary homotopy is presumed to be fiberwise.
