# Paused and fiberwise formulations of weak lifting

Weak covering-homotopy lifting is equivalent to exact lifting for homotopies
which are stationary during the first half of the interval. This provides
the exact initial-value formulation needed for cutoff-controlled collar
lifting, while preserving the already proved homotopy-pullback comparison.
