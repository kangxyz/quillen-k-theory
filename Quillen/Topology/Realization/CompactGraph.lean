/-! # Closed graphs of compact tests in actual simplicial realizations

The actual map factors through a finite realized subcomplex, whose inclusion
is a closed embedding and whose realization is Hausdorff. This gives the
closed matching locus needed for quotient descent without assuming the
entire realization Hausdorff.
