# Joint finite vertex straightening for an actual embedding

Normalize the source while fixing every already-based source simplex. Its
actual image tracks agree with the stationary tracks on any based fixed target
family, because injectivity reflects each original source vertex. The joined
prescribed family is then extended by genuine finite simplex HEP to the whole
target support. Every repeated simplex and every face is indexed by actual map
equality, and source/target agreement holds at every original point and time.
