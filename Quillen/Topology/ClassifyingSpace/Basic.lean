# Based classifying spaces and shifted homotopy groups

For a category `C`, its classifying space is the genuine geometric realization
of its nerve. An object `c : C` supplies a vertex and hence a point of this
space. We define the shifted homotopy groups `π_(n+1) (|nerve C|) c` using
mathlib's quotient of based continuous maps by based homotopy.

This file is generic infrastructure. It does not assert that an arbitrary
category defines Quillen K-theory. The Quillen construction must first supply
the appropriate Q-category and its distinguished object.

The shifted group in degree zero is only a group in this generality. The
positive-degree shifted groups are commutative, by the existing
Eckmann–Hilton theorem for higher homotopy groups.
