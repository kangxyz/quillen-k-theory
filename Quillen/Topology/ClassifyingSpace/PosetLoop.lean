# Original classifying-space loops and the actual poset resolution

The proved poset-resolution homotopy equivalence sends the canonical
singleton-chain vertex to the original categorical vertex. Vertex HEP
constructs a based inverse and point-fixed inverse homotopies, which then
loop to a genuine equivalence of the actual compact-open loop spaces.

In particular, loops of the original Q classifying space reduce to loops of
a poset nerve. This does not yet supply a realization model or CW type for
either loop space.
