# Common coordinate mass of two metric order-complex points

The pointwise minimum has support exactly the intersection of the supports.
For probability coordinates its mass is exactly one minus half the L1 distance.
Thus positive common mass is an open diagonal neighborhood even when the two
supports have a union which is not a chain. This is the first algebraic input
for a diagonal-fixed local connector, not an assumption of equiconnectivity.
