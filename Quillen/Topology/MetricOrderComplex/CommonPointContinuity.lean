# Actual L1 continuity of normalized common points

At a fixed center x, the common-mass sum can be taken over the one finite
support of x. The identity dist(x,y)=2-2*commonMass(x,y) therefore controls
the entire L1 distance using finitely many coordinates of y, including its
varying tail. This proves a coordinate continuity criterion for these positive
total-one distributions; no such criterion is assumed for general L1 vectors.
Normalization then gives a continuous common point on the open overlap domain.
