# A continuous cutoff map into the original weak realization

Reconstruct the normalized half-maximum cutoff. Near each metric point its
support lies in that point's one fixed finite chain, where reconstruction is
continuous. This proves actual continuity from the L1 model to the weak
realization without asserting continuity of the unmodified set inverse.
