# The categorical resolution used in Quillen's Theorem A

For a functor `F : C ⥤ D`, the resolution has objects `(c, d, F c ⟶ d)`.
Its projection to `C` has a fully faithful left adjoint, and consequently is
already a homotopy equivalence after taking nerves and realization. The other
projection has comma categories `(F ↓ d)` as its strict fibers.

This file proves the categorical and simplicial assertions, including the
identification with the Grothendieck construction of `d ↦ (F ↓ d)`. It does
not assert that fiberwise contractibility makes the second projection a
homotopy equivalence: that is the additional homotopy-colimit theorem needed
for the general Theorem A criterion.
