# Realized deformation retractions for the Theorem A resolutions

Both comma resolutions have actual classifying spaces homotopy equivalent to
the source category, via the canonical source projection. Their target maps
are compared to the map induced by `F` by genuine continuous homotopies.

No contractible-fiber implication for the target projection is assumed or
proved here. That implication requires the remaining homotopy-colimit theorem.
