# The structured-arrow orientation of the Theorem A resolution

For the criterion using `(d ↓ F)`, the resolution uses arrows `d ⟶ F c`.
The identity-arrow section is now a right adjoint, and change of `d` in the
comma category is contravariant. These variance choices are explicit rather
than silently identifying structured with costructured arrows.
