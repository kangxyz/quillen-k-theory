# The resolved and original homotopy fibers are genuinely equivalent

The resolution's source projection is an actual homotopy equivalence. Its
structure-arrow homotopy and path-space homotopy invariance give an explicit
equivalence from the resolved target fiber to the fiber of `|N F|`.
We identify the comma comparison under this equivalence up to an actual
continuous homotopy, obtained by removing a constant terminal path segment.
