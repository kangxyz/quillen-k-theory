# Quillen's Theorem B on all based homotopy sets

The actual transition homotopy-equivalence hypothesis now implies the
canonical comma-to-homotopy-fiber comparison is bijective in every finite
homotopy degree, including degree zero. The finite cartesian stage input
is proved by simultaneous skeletal induction, rather than assumed.
