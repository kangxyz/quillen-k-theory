# The canonical comparison in Quillen's Theorem B

We use the covariant comma categories `(F ↓ d)`. Their structure arrows give
an actual continuous nullhomotopy of the projection followed by `|N F|`, and
hence the canonical map into the genuine path-space homotopy fiber.

Theorem B's hypothesis is stated for the actual postcomposition maps of
classifying spaces. Merely defining this hypothesis and comparison is not
an assertion that the comparison is a homotopy equivalence.
