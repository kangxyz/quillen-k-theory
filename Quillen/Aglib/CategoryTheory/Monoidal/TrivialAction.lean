# The trivial action of a monoidal category

`MonoidalLeftAction.trivial C D` is the monoidal left action which ignores `C`:
every acting object induces the identity functor of `D`, every acting morphism
induces an identity, and the action associators and unitors are identity
isomorphisms. It is a named definition rather than a global instance, so it does
not compete with other actions on `D`.
